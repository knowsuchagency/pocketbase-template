# PocketBase Template Project

## Overview
Go-based backend-as-a-service (BaaS) application built on PocketBase (v0.28+).

## Quick Commands
```bash
just serve                    # Start dev server on port 8090
just makemigration "name"    # Create new migration
just migrate                 # Run migrations
just show-schema            # Display database schema
```

## Key Points
- Single binary with embedded SQLite database
- Auto-migration enabled in development (via `--dev` flag)
- Migrations in `_ "app/migrations"` module
- Data persistence in `pb_data/` directory
- Docker support with Alpine-based multi-stage build

## Migration Guidelines
- Use `just makemigration` to create migrations
- Each migration has up/down functions
